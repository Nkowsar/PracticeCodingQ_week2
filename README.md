# PractoceCodingQ_week2

Problem Statement
● Create an interface IShape
Attributes: area, colour, perimeter, type
Methods: calculate the area, calculate the perimeter, draw the shape
● Implement the following inheritance
Rectangle->IShape
Square->Rectangle
● Implement two draw methods which will take IShape and message as parameter
resp. (Compile-time Polymorphism).
● Implement composition: Shape has a Renderer. Renderer is a class that contains draw
methods.
● Implement runtime polymorphism in Square class by implementing the calculate area
method.
● Please fill up Triangle and circle classes based on it
● Goal to be able to print the area and perimeter of Triangle and Circle
● Also, please complete the UML diagram of the whole project and revise the concepts,
discuss with your friends their design
